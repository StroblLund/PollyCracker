# Toy implementation of Polly Cracker in Python

This is not safe code! Do not use this for encryption! This is a toy eample of Polly Cracker implemented in Python which I use for my Master thesis at university.

The Source Code also includes a routine that checks if the "Intelligent Linear Algebra Attack" [1] works and an implementation of the Differential Attack described by [2].
